This code snippet addresses the feedback from the oracle by using type annotations, organizing imports, utilizing data classes, enhancing error handling, following consistent naming conventions, documenting functions with detailed docstrings, and implementing logging for better debugging and monitoring. The code is also structured to be modular and includes comprehensive tests to ensure its correctness.
